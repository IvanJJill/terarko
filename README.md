This is a project for Turtle Terrarium
it is running on TI Launchpad
I'm working on it as a homework project for online course on edx.org

Currently what is done - simple framework to define generic I/O - at the moment only digital I/O works propeerly

Set up is:
- UV Lamp for turtle's shell
- LED lamp for general light
- watering pump
- pump to feed water into watering tank
- 4 button control panel

was working to add a screen but this part is not finished
